<p> My main challenge during this project was remembering what specific coding operations I needed to use to do different actions.
Luckily for me I had Ava to tell me when there was something I didn't know. For example, at one point during this project I
couldn't figure out how to hyperlink from one html page to another, so Ava explained how we do that. </p>
